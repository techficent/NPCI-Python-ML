Machine Learning:

        a) Supervised Learning : The attribute to be predicted (expected as
         output from the model) IS ALSO
                PRESENT IN THE HISTORICAL DATA!

                i)classification : when target column is categorical
                ii)Prediction :  when target column is real-value

        b) Unsupervised Learning : The attribute to be predicted (expected as output from the model) IS NOT
                PRESENT IN THE HISTORICAL DATA!

        c) Reinforcement Learning : Act of changing approach of modelling based on feedback!



Supervised Learning Model Preparation Sequence


1) Source your data!!! : [    Fetch,pull, bring, or identify the right data required for model preparation    ]

2) Data exploration & Preprocessing: Understand and gain insight into data.
Then, pre-process the data to deal with issues such as (but not limited to)
    a) Encoding
    b) Scaling
    c) Cleaning of data
    d) Feature Engineering*

3) Selecting of features & target: Identify what columns of the table can be deciding factors (judgement criteria)
        and what column represents target (expected_output)

4) split the data for training & testing : 
    100 rows

    ratio split (randomly)
    divide the data in folds : In each fold maintain original data ratio*
    Stratified folding : Divide data in folds, use most folds from training & remaining 
            for testing

5) training of the model: Select all applicable algorithms and apply the algorithm on training samples!


6) Evaluating/testing the model : Choose applicable metrics (evaluation techniques)
        to test and rate the model as acceptable or not acceptable


BONUS STEP:   YOU MAY  NEED TO TUNE THE MODEL FOR BETTER PERFORMANCE!


7) DEPLOYMENT OF THE MODEL : Provision the launch of the model in a convenient format so that it is accessible to end-clients
